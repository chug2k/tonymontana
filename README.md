# Installation instructions 
I was just going to put some Tony Montana Quotes in here, but here are some installation instructions instead:

1. clone this repo
2. bundle install
3. dashing start

server should be up at `localhost:3030`

landing page things are in directories called static_layout, except for the views themselves which are nestled under `/dashboards`. I'll have to figure out how to change view.root nicely. 

## Tony Montana Quotes 


Tony Montana: Me, I want what's coming to me. 
Manny: Oh, well what's coming to you? 
Tony Montana: The world, chico, and everything in it.
